excerpt: "This seminar introduces students to empirical approaches for studying diversity in organizational contexts. Against the backdrop of ongoing demographic and social changes, we critically examine how diversity manifests in the workplace and how it can be researched from a social science perspective. The course emphasizes the development of students' methodological skills: from formulating a compelling research question and hypotheses, to designing a suitable research study to investigate workplace inequality and inclusion.
Through the lens of contemporary challenges—such as gender inequality and underrepresentation in leadership—students learn how to connect theoretical concepts with real-world organizational dynamics and begin shaping their own research perspectives.;  **Student satisfaction:** 1.1 (scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the best rating)"
