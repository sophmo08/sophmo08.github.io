**Undergraduate Seminar in Winter Semester 2022**

This undergraduate seminar provides a broad introduction to key theories and concepts relevant to understanding diversity in teams and organizations. We explore how societal shifts—such as increased female labor participation, demographic change, and international migration—are shaping increasingly diverse workplaces.

Students engage with questions such as: What types of diversity exist? How does diversity affect collaboration and performance in teams? What challenges arise, and what opportunities can diversity create? And ultimately: How can organizations manage diversity effectively?

In addition to exploring topics like the gender pay gap and female representation in top management, the course integrates academic writing training to support students in crafting their very first term papers.

**Student satisfaction:** 1.4 (scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the best rating)
