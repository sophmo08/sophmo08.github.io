excerpt: "Undergraduate Seminar in Winter Semester 2022 and Winter Semester 2023

Ongoing societal developments have led to increasing diversity among employees in teams and organizations. For instance, rising labor force participation among women, demographic change, and international migration are all contributing to increasingly diverse workforces and more heterogeneous teams.
This seminar provides an overview of key theories and concepts essential for understanding diversity in organizational contexts. We address questions such as: What types of diversity exist? What are the effects of diversity in the workplace? What challenges and opportunities does diversity present? And finally: How can diversity be effectively managed?
In addition to exploring these content areas, students will also develop methodological skills. These include formulating relevant research questions and hypotheses, structuring academic papers, and designing appropriate research methods to investigate their questions.
Student satisfaction: 1.1 (scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the best rating)
