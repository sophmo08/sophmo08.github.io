Undergraduate Seminar in Summer Semester 2025

This seminar introduces students to empirical research methods in organizational behavior, with a focus on both qualitative and quantitative approaches. It aims to provide a solid understanding of a variety of research designs, data collection techniques, and analytical methods commonly used in organizational research, while also fostering critical thinking about the ethical and practical implications of conducting research in organizational settings. Students will learn to develop research questions, design appropriate studies, and apply data collection and analysis techniques. The course covers methods such as regression analysis, multilevel modeling, (quasi-)experimental designs, and case study research. By designing and conducting their own research projects, students gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how to investigate current trends and challenges in organizations.

Co-taught together with Amelie Fischer (University of Konstanz)
