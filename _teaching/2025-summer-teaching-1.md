excerpt: "Undergraduate Seminar in Summer Semester 2025: This seminar introduces students to empirical research methods in organizational studies, with a focus on both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The course encourages critical reflection on the ethical and practical implications of research in organizational contexts, while exploring how organizations of the future can be studied and shaped.
Students will learn to develop research questions, design appropriate studies, and apply data collection and analysis techniques. The course covers methods such as regression analysis, multilevel modeling, (quasi-)experimental designs, and case study research. By designing and conducting their own small research projects, students gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of how to investigate current trends and challenges in organizations."
