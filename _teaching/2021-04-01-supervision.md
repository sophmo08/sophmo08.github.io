Since 2022, I (co-)supervise undergraduate and graduate theses (Bachelor’s and Master’s) on topics related to inequality in the workplace. My supervision spans a wide range of disciplines, including students from the Politics, Public Administration and Management track, as well as those studying Psychology or Data Science. I support students in developing theoretically grounded research questions and applying appropriate quantitative methods to investigate issues such as diversity, discrimination, leadership, or organizational change in the context of work and employment.
