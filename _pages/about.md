I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/kunze/team/research-associates/sophie-moser-ma/), where I investigate gender inequality at the workplace. My research is part of the Cluster of Excellence ["The Politics of Inequality"](https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/about-us/persons/full-list-of-cluster-members/moser-sophie/).

I investigate how employees’ demographic characteristics shape workplace experiences and outcomes—and how organizational practices and broader societal structures influence these dynamics. For instance: What challenges do individuals face in gender-atypical occupations? And can organizational DEI goals truly help close the gender pay gap—or are they merely pinkwashing? To explore such questions, I apply a range of quantitative methods, including multilevel modeling, panel data analysis, and machine learning techniques. My work has repeatedly been recognized with awards, such as the [William H. Newman Award for the Academy-wide Best Paper based on a Dissertation](https://aom.org/membership/awards-and-recognition/annual-meeting-program-awards/2024-annual-meeting-program-awards) and the [Best Student Paper Award](https://dei.aom.org/dei/awards/beststudentpaper) from the DEI Division of the Academy of Management.

In addition to research, I am passionate about teaching. I design and lead seminars on diversity, organizational transformation, and the future of work, and I co-supervise theses at both the undergraduate and graduate level on issues related to inequality in organizational contexts.
